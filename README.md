# 📝 Sign-Up Form

This project was built as part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project curriculum.
Its goal is to recreate a sign-up form layout based on the provided design, using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

This exercise deepens your understanding of form structure, form controls, and styling web UI components.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main aim of this project was to build a responsive, accessible, and visually accurate sign-up form that resembles the lesson’s design file — including input fields, buttons, and layout structure — using only HTML and CSS.

---
## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

During this project, I worked with:
- Semantic HTML form structure
- Various form controls (<input>, <label>, <button>, etc.)
- Styling inputs with CSS
- Form validation styling
- UX considerations for focus and interaction states
- Working with external fonts and images

---
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 – For semantic structure
- CSS3 – For layout and visual design

No JavaScript was required — this project focuses on layout and form UI rather than client-side interactivity.

---
## 📈 Possible Future Improvements

- Add real form validation using JavaScript
- Make the form responsive for mobile screens
- Add client-side interactivity (e.g., show/hide password)- 
- Animate focus and validation states
